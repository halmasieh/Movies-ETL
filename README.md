# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview
In this analysis, we started with data pipline process which means Extract, Transform, and load or ETL. ETL is the process of moving information between
databases. For example Google and Amazon are constantly moving data around to different locations to improve performance. ETL is a core concept in data engineering 
insures the data is consistant and maintains integrated because without consistant robust data any forrm of analysis is impossible.
The ETL process can also create data store, that perform more efficiently reducing the time. We will be using pandas and Python to perform our data wrangling 
and PostgresSQL to store our finished data. 

This project is done as follows:
   - Create an automated pipeline that takes in new data
   - Perform the appropriate transformations
   - Load the data into existing table and create the Movie Database. 



## Resources
- Data Sources: movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv, wikipedia-movies.json
- Software: [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), [PostgresSQL](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads)
- Module: pandas, numpy, json, re, create_engine, db_password, time  


## Summary

Using the knowledge of Python, Pandas, the ETL process, to achieve the following goals:

Most people over 65 years who retire soon are Engineers and Senior Staffs, repectively, therefore, the need to employ these two roles is a priority.
The rest of roles will need to be filled are Staff, Senior Engineer, Technique Leader, Assisstant Engineer and Manager, respectively.

The table below shows the trainees in the mentorship eligiblity program according to the different job titles:

Comparing the above two tables, it is quite clear that the number of qualified trainees in the mentorship program who can replace with 
the silver tsunami retirees is not enough and Pewlett-Hackard needs to train more people to be able to hold various roles in this large company.
The code for the tables is available [here](https://github.com/halmasieh/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/silver_tsunami.sql).
